Implement view:
an activity,
inflate custom view,
create departures presenter
create presenter for service
service for notifications?
notification view (builer), action on notification to stop
tear down notification



------ redesign ------
- keep controllers/presenters within boundary and attach views to controller
- still keep the "show" operation as this is a "ui navigation" concern
- when view attaches to core it gets updates of state etc
